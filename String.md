### Accessing the characters in String through index

We can use indexes to access individual characters in a C++ String. String in C++ are usually represented using the std::string class, and the characters in them can be accessed using indexe

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string myString = "Hello, World!";
    
    // Access individual characters in a String
    char characterAtIndex0 = myString[0]; // Access the first character "H"
    char characterAtIndex5 = myString[5]; // Accessing  the sixth character ","

    std::cout << "Character at index 0: " << characterAtIndex0 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Character at index 5: " << characterAtIndex5 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```


### std::string and char splicing

In cpp we can splice std::string and  char together directly. And char and char are also concatenate into std::string.

Splicing std::string and char

```cpp
//Splice using "+"
std::string result = "Hello, " + std::string(1, 'A');

//Splice using append function
std::string result = "Hello, ";
result.append(1, 'A');

//splice using "+="
std::string result = "Hello, ";
result += 'A'; // 字符 'A' 会自动转换为字符串


```
